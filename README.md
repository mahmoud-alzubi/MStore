# MStore ðŸ›’
<b>MStore</b> MStore is a backend project for an online shopping store that follows a parent-child Maven structure. It includes microservices for Inventory, Orders, and Products, and utilizes MongoDB and MySQL databases. The project incorporates integration testing using Test Containers to ensure reliable and comprehensive system functionality testing.

To implement efficient RESTful APIs, MStore leverages the Java and Spring Boot framework. This framework allows for seamless management of inventory, order processing, and product information in the online store.

Additionally, MStore applies the service discovery pattern to enhance communication between the microservices. By utilizing a service discovery mechanism, the project enables dynamic and automated service registration and discovery. This means that microservices within the MStore ecosystem can locate and communicate with each other without the need for explicit configuration. This approach improves the scalability and fault tolerance of the system, as new microservices can be easily added or removed without impacting the overall functionality.
