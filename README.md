# MStore ðŸ›’
<b>MStore</b> MStore is a backend project for an online shopping store following a parent-child Maven structure. It includes microservices for Inventory, Orders, and Products and utilizes MongoDB and MySQL databases. The project incorporates integration testing using Test Containers, ensuring reliable and comprehensive system functionality testing. It leverages the Java and Spring Boot framework to implement efficient RESTful APIs, enabling seamless management of inventory, order processing, and product information in the online store. In addition, MStore applies the service discovery pattern to enhance communication between the microservices. By utilizing a service discovery mechanism, the project enables dynamic and automated service registration and discovery. This allows the microservices within the MStore ecosystem to locate and communicate with each other without the need for explicit configuration, and improves the scalability and fault tolerance of the system, as new microservices can be easily added or removed without impacting the overall functionality.
